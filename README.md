# datafun-05-data-at-rest

> Module 5 deals with data at rest. Data at rest may be kept in:

files,
relational databases (e.g., SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle), 
NoSQL datastores (e.g., MongoDB)
Graph databases (e.g., Neo4J)
and more. 
We'll look at how to read and write from files and relational databases.

# Get started in GitHub

Log in to your GitHub account. 
Create a new GitHub repo named datafun-05-data-at-rest. Follow conventions - use kebob, lower case, no spaces. 
Git clone your new repo into your Documents folder. 
Always ensure your repo has the basic files all our repos need:
a good README.md,
.gitignore
Copy these from previous repos as needed. This is done in a notebook - no need for logger. We'll show results in the notebook.
Update README.md to reflect the focus of this module.

Since I am a big football fan, my domain is American Football. This repo will show proficiencies in reading and writing various types of files within VSCode and the understanding of 
SQL in relation to python. I am excited to learn these techniques so I have the opportunity to do some football analysis that I have always wanted to do!"""
